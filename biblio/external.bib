The proposed method uses extended equal area criterion (EEAC) to determine the critical clearing time and critical clearing angle of the system, which are vital information for the OOS protection setting calculation. The dynamic model parameters and the coherency groups of the system for EEAC analysis are determined in real time to ensure that the newly calculated settings suit with the prevalent system operating condition. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated in simulated data from a 16-machine 68-bus system model.}, number={4}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery}, author={Ariff, M. A.

    abstract = { A novel method for detecting and identifying three fundamental anomalies, i.e. occurrence of bad data, changes in network configuration and sudden variation of states, in dynamic state estimation for electric power systems is proposed. Examination of innovation processes in the Kalman filter is appropriately used in each step of the detection of anomalies, discrimination between anomalies and application of counterplans. Discrimination between the anomalies is performed by a test based on skewness or the chi-square value of distributions of the innovation processes, although changes in network configuration and sudden variations of states are not always separable. Counterplans, which are different for each case of the anomalies, are developed so as to prevent deterioration in the accuracy of the estimator. Simulation results show that this algorithm works excellently. }

abstract="A power system state estimation is one of the most important applications in the power system control center. Power systems are continuously monitored in order to determine a reliable data of the state variables. Conventional power system state estimators, which are iterative and less accurate, are subject to important changes because of the extensive use of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). Although there are many advantages related to their use, PMUs are highly expensive and cannot be implemented at all buses. Therefore, it is very important to find an optimal number of PMUs and their locations in power system to achieve full observability. This paper presents an overview of different techniques for power system state estimation. It also investigates the outcomes of including PMUs in conventional state estimation process. The effectiveness of the proposed state estimation techniques is validated using IEEE test system with 14 buses.",

ABSTRACT = {Power grid dispatching is a high-risk process, and its execution depends on an available cyber system. However, the effects of cyber systems have not caught enough attention in current research on risk assessments in dispatching processes, which may cause optimistic risk results. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a risk assessment model that considers the impact of a cyber system on power grid dispatching processes. Firstly, a cyber-physical switchgear state model that integrates the reliability states of both cyber system functions and switchgears is proposed, based on the transition of switchgear states in the dispatching process. Then, the potential effects of each operating step on power grid states are analyzed considering the failure model of cyber-physical system (CPS) components. The risk probabilities and consequences of the power grid states are calculated to quantify the risk index. Finally, the workings and effectiveness of this model are illustrated using the IEEE Reliability Test System-1979.},

abstract="A power system state estimation is one of the most important applications in the power system control center. Power systems are continuously monitored in order to determine a reliable data of the state variables. Conventional power system state estimators, which are iterative and less accurate, are subject to important changes because of the extensive use of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). Although there are many advantages related to their use, PMUs are highly expensive and cannot be implemented at all buses. Therefore, it is very important to find an optimal number of PMUs and their locations in power system to achieve full observability. This paper presents an overview of different techniques for power system state estimation. It also investigates the outcomes of including PMUs in conventional state estimation process. The effectiveness of the proposed state estimation techniques is validated using IEEE test system with 14 buses.",

abstract = {State estimator is crucial for on-line power system monitoring, analysis and control. With the increasing use of synchronized phasor measurement units (PMU) in power grids, how to utilize phasor measurements to improve the precision of state estimator becomes imperative. Since there are lots of traditional measurements in SCADA system and it is hard for phasor measurements to replace them in the near future, the best way is to develop hybrid state estimator which includes both phasor and traditional measurements to get better behavior. In this paper, a novel state estimator for including voltage phasors, branch current phasors and traditional measurements is proposed. The detailed model and how to calculate covariance matrix of PMU measurements are described in detail. New England 39-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system are used as test systems and the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed state estimation algorithm improves the precision greatly and gets better behavior as compared with other state estimators with or without phasor measurements.}

    abstract = { A novel method for detecting and identifying three fundamental anomalies, i.e. occurrence of bad data, changes in network configuration and sudden variation of states, in dynamic state estimation for electric power systems is proposed. Examination of innovation processes in the Kalman filter is appropriately used in each step of the detection of anomalies, discrimination between anomalies and application of counterplans. Discrimination between the anomalies is performed by a test based on skewness or the chi-square value of distributions of the innovation processes, although changes in network configuration and sudden variations of states are not always separable. Counterplans, which are different for each case of the anomalies, are developed so as to prevent deterioration in the accuracy of the estimator. Simulation results show that this algorithm works excellently. }

Therefore, it is necessary to establish a dynamic model for the time evolution of the state vector. The dynamic state estimation approach consists of predicting the state vector based on past estimations, followed by a filtering process performed when a new set of measurements is available. This paper presents a new algorithm for forecasting and filtering the state vector, using exponential smoothing and least-squares estimation techniques. The proposed algorithm is compared with another one based on standard Kalman filtering theory. Numerical results showing the performance for both dynamic estimators under different operational conditions are presented and discussed. Detection and identification of multiple bad data are also included. The new dynamic estimator exploiting state forecasting is extremely useful to real-time monitoring of power systems. }

The EKF system uses a linearised measurement equation, neglecting the nonlinearities of the measurement function. Under certain circumstances (e.g. large load changes) this leads to degradation in the filter performance. Two algorithms are proposed for dynamic state estimation which incorporate the measurement function nonlinearities in the EKF scheme. The performance of the schemes are compared with the standard linear EKF scheme under various conditions and comparative results are presented. }

    abstract = { A new estimation method for power system dynamic state estimation, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), is presented. It is based on the application of the unscented transformation (UT) combined with the Kalman filter theory. One of the challenges in the process of power system estimation is coping with a highly non-linear mathematical model of network equations, which is usually approximated through a linearisation. The new derivative free estimation method overcomes this limitation using the UT and achieves better accuracy with simpler implementation. The UKF is derived and demonstrated using three different test power systems under typical network and measurement conditions. Its performance is compared with the classical extended Kalman filter. The simplicity of the new estimator and its low computational demand make it a better option to be applied in the next generation of dynamic system estimators. }

abstract = {Accurate information about generator rotor speeds and angles plays an important role for power system transient stability online assessment and protection. To address this need, this paper proposes a fast and robust estimation approach based on the model transformation strategy. Thanks to this strategy, the original complex nonlinear model is transformed into a linear one without linerization, which makes the dynamical system observability analysis and the estimation problem significantly easier to solve. The proposed model transformation strategy is achieved by taking the measured generator active power as the input variable and the derived frequency and the rate of change of frequency measurements from the phasor measurement units (PMUs) as the output variables of the dynamical generator model. This allows us to estimate the generator rotor speeds and angles using only local PMU measurements and the swing equations, relaxing the need of a detailed generator model on which the existing dynamic state estimators are based. A robust Kalman filter is also developed to handle data quality problems as the frequency and rate of change of frequency measurements can be biased in presence of severe disturbance or communication issues. Comparison results carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system successfully validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach under various conditions.}

Dynamic state estimation in power systems provides synchronized wide area system history of the dynamic events which is key in the analysis and understanding of the system performance, behavior, and the types of control decisions to be made for large scale power system contingencies. In this paper, 2-axis-fourth-order state space modeling and validation of the synchronous machine is explained in detail. The model is then used for dynamic state estimation using EKF in IEEE 3-Generator-9-Bus Test System. The simulation results show that the model and estimation approach are capable to provide accurate information about the states of the machine and eliminate the noise effects on the measurement signal. The main challenges of dynamic estimation in large power systems are also addressed in this paper.}

abstract = {This paper presents a new method for the assessment of the process noise covariance matrix for three-phase dynamic state estimation in unbalanced active distribution networks which operate under normal conditions. The assessment is done in order to minimize the estimation error. The proposed assessment method, based on minimization of a particular cost function, enables the a priori assessment of covariance matrix by extracting information from previously observed measurements, without the need to simulate the true state of the system. The method was applied on two commonly used Kalman filter based estimation algorithms in nonlinear systems: Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). A comparative analysis was performed between two different cost functions based on average root mean square of innovations and maximum likelihood technique. Also, the importance of determining initial state vector and its error covariance matrix needed for the initialization of dynamic state estimation was examined, as well as the ability of UKF and EKF to handle measurement nonlinearities. The analysis was carried out and the proposed method was verified on modified IEEE 13- and 37-bus distribution test systems.}

In this article, through extensive simulations, the CKF was compared to four different types of forecasting-aided state estimators (FASEs) including extended Kalman filter (EKF), iterated EKF, second-order Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter under normal operation and bad data conditions. Identifying the challenge that the estimation accuracy of the existing CKF-based estimator is significantly lower than that of the other FASEs in the cases of sudden load change, and sudden topology change caused by faults an attempt to improve the CKF accuracy has been undertaken. The existing detection methods cannot accurately detect and distinguish those anomalies, and they cannot identify the anomaly location. This article proposes an improved algorithm for CKF-based FASE that overcomes the drawbacks of the existing CKF-based FASEs using a novel anomaly detection algorithm. The simulation results show that the new anomaly detection method is superior to the two existing anomaly detection algorithms. The simulations are performed in the above-mentioned four cases in IEEE 14 and 118 bus test systems in MATLAB.}, number={5}, journal={International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems}, author={Jin, Zhaoyang and Chakrabarti, Saikat and Yu, James and Ding, Lei and Terzija, Vladimir}, year={2021}, month=may, language={en} }

abstract = {In this Note, we study interacting particle approximations of discrete time and measure valued dynamical systems. Such systems have arisen in such diverse scientific disciplines as in Propagation of Chaos Theory (see [12] and [19]), and in Nonlinear Filtering Theory. The main contribution of this Note is to prove the convergences to the optimal filter of such approximations, yielding what seemed to be the first mathematically well-founded convergence results for such approximations of the nonlinear filtering equations. This new treatment was influenced primarily by the development of genetic algorithms (see [16] and [3]), and secondarily by the papers of H. Kunita and L. Stettner, [17] and [18] respectively.
Résumé
Cette Note présente une méthode de résolution particulaire de systèmes dynamiques à valeurs mesures, basée sur la simulation de systèmes de particules en interaction. Ces techniques permettent d'aborder l'étude de certaines équations étudiées dans la Théorie de la propagation du chaos (voir [12] et [19]), et tout particulièrement les équations du filtrage non-linéaire. Un des principaux résultats de cette Note concerne la convergence vers le filtre optimal de ces approximations particulaires. Ces résultats constituent, à la connaissance de l'auteur, la première démonstration de convergence de telles approximations des équations du filtrage non-linéaire. Cette nouvelle approche a été influencée par le développement des Algorithmes Génétiques (voir [16] et [3]), et par les articles de H. Kunita et L. Stettner,[17] et [18] respectivement.}

abstract = {This paper presents an iterative dynamic state estimation including detection and identification of bad data. The bad data are detected by tests of asymmetry on the updated information, and the identification of measurements with gross errors is made by finding the normalized updated information with the largest standard deviation. The iterative procedure avoids the recalculation of the Kalman gain as well as the covariance matrix of the estimation errors. In the estimation process the Riccati equation is solved by the double algorithm method, working only with its diagonal part. Two main types of test were carried out: on the iterative model itself; and on the bad data processing. The model has been tested on part of a large interconnected pool in the eastern United States.}

abstract = {The state estimator’s real-time state information plays a vital role in monitoring and control of the power system. As a result, one of the primary requirements of the estimator is to provide accurate state estimates with good convergence under varied system operating conditions. In this context, dynamic state estimation (DSE) consistently tracks the power system dynamics and delivers real-time system state evolution. In literature, this dynamic state estimation (SE) problem is generally solved using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The EKF approach neglects the non-linear mathematical functions of network equations by linearly approximating the measurement equations. This leads to degradation of SE accuracy during a sudden change in load conditions. In this paper, a new derivative-free method based on square-root cubature Kalman filter (SCKF) is proposed to overcome the limitations of the EKF technique and achieves improved performance. The proposed SCKF technique has been tested on IEEE 14-bus, IEEE 30-bus, and IEEE 57-bus systems under various operating conditions. The effectiveness of the SCKF technique has been compared with the traditional EKF and cubature Kalman filter (CKF) techniques using different performance indices. The obtained results demonstrate the versatility of the proposed SCKF technique.}

abstract = {A family of algorithms for the identification of continuous-time nonlinear plants operating in closed loop is presented. An adjustable closed-loop output error-type predictor parameterized in terms of the existing controller and the estimated plant model is used. The algorithms are derived from stability considerations in the absence of noise and assuming that the plant model is in the model set. Some convergence results based on passivity concepts are presented. Subsequently, the algorithms are analyzed in the presence of noise and when the plant model is not in the model set.}

MLE and clustering are applied to a class of differential systems that describe electromechanical and electromagnetic processes in multi-machine power grids. The authors contribute by employing this combined method for automatic labeling of voltage measurement sets, allowing the differentiation of transient regimes in the power system (PS), which can distinguish STVI among switching events in normal operational mode, faults. The obtained results can be utilized for comprehensive monitoring of transient regimes in the PS. We support our results with numerical experiments in PSCAD simulation software.",

    abstract = {Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) have been in the focus of attention of the energy storage community over the past years. Adequate, reliable and user-friendly mathematical models are required for the development and optimal application of this type of battery. A large amount of literature has been devoted to dynamic models of VRFBs, but insufficient attention has been paid to the comparison and critical analysis of their applicability. The article provides a comprehensive overview of available dynamic models, comparing their applicability for real-time simulation of industrial-scale vanadium redox flow batteries. In addition, a methodology for the models comparison is proposed, which takes into account different modes of operation and allows to determine the applicability range of a particular model. The results of the study show that lumped-parameter models with crossover performs well for simulating battery dynamics in the wide range of operating conditions: state of charge (SOC) – (0.1–0.8), load current – (20–290 mA/cm2), flow velocity (0.4–2.7 cm/s). Also, such models can be tuned even if some physical parameters of the battery components (e.g. electrodes and membrane) are unknown. The results obtained can be used to provide more accurate simulation of vanadium redox flow batteries in real-time monitoring and control tasks, when accuracy and performance are important.},

    abstract = {A 0-D dynamic mathematical model for a single Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB) cell is proposed. The model is based on the conservation principles of charge and mass transfer focusing on the precise simulation of crossover with diﬀusion, migration and convection. The inﬂuence of these phenomena on the capacity decay was systematically analyzed, revealing considerable impact of convection component, which dominates under diffusion and migration and mainly responsible for observed capacity loss. The model allows to simulate main characteristics of VRFB systems (such as battery voltage, state of charge, charge/discharge time and capacity decay due to crossover) with high accuracy. The model was validated with experimental data in the wide range of current densities (40–100 mA cm−2), and the results demonstrated good agreement with experiments having an average error within 5\% range. In addition, the model requires a modest computational time and power, and, therefore, it can be suitable for application in advanced control-monitoring tools, which are necessary for a longservice life and sustainable operation of VRFB systems.},

    abstract = {In this work, we propose a two-stage parameter identification algorithm for the zero-dimensional model of vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) based on the fitting of the available experimental data. Specifically, in the first stage, the parameters of overpotentials are obtained from the discharge polarization curve at the state of charge of 50\%. In the second stage, the parameters of capacity loss and crossover are identified by the mini­ mization of square error between the predicted and experimental charge-discharge curves at a certain value of load current. The algorithm allows to assess the degree of degradation of the battery components, and capture the effects associated with crossover and mass transfer limitations at high load currents and low flow rates. We verify this algorithm with a reference simulation considering the most interesting practical cases of battery use and validate it with three experimental VRFB systems with power and capacity ratings in the range of 5–10 kW and 5–100 kWh, correspondingly. The results show a good agreement with experimental data having an average error value of less than 1\%. The results of the study are an important step in further developments of advanced control algorithms for large-scale energy storage systems.},

abstract = {Accurate fault location methods for transmission lines are essential to ensure secure and reliable operation of power systems. Among various fault location approaches, model-based fault location methods are widely adopted in practical power systems since they are compatible with typical data acquisition systems and have clear physical meanings. There are extensive phasor domain and time domain model-based approaches in the existing literature, however, the connections among various line models, as well as corresponding fault location approaches, are not fully investigated. To this end, this paper first systematically reviews transmission line modeling framework for fault location, including time domain and phasor domain matrix/scalar form lumped/distributed parameter models. The relationships between these models are carefully presented and discussed, with clear assumptions for each model. Next, different phasor domain and time domain model-based fault location methods using various line models are shown in detail. Finally, numerical experiments verify the differences between different model-based methods and the importance to use accurate line models for transmission line fault location. The results also clearly indicate the advantages of time domain model-based methods over phasor domain methods: the time domain approaches can accurately locate faults using a short data window within half a cycle after the fault occurs. Compared to traveling wave based methods, the time domain model-based methods are compatible with available data acquisition hardware in substations, with a relatively low sampling rates of several kilo-samples/sec.}

However, their functionality is mainly based on simulation models of the entire system behavior. For modular multi-domain systems, this requires the extensive use of dynamically composed models that are made up of individual component models. The FMIStandard forms a solid foundation for this problem and is very well known in the automotive engineering fields. However, composed system models using FMI are not widely adapted in renewable energy and wind energy yet. So far, the coupling of simulation models is limited. This paper discusses the strategy of building digital twins from individual FMUs with predefined model interfaces based on an ontology for renewable energy systems. An accelerated development is enabled by the exchange of sub-models in the digital twin without adjustments of interface. An example for the proposed process is given by the composed simulation model of a hydrogen generation process based on wind energy.}, author={Marcus Wiens and Tobias Meyer and Philipp Thomas}, year={2021}, month=sep, pages={235–240}, language={en} }

In recent years, it has become possible to synchronize waveform data measured from different locations. Thus large-scale coordinated analyses of multiple waveforms over a wide area are within our reach. This development could unleash a set of new concepts, strategies, and tools for monitoring, protecting, and controlling power systems and apparatuses. This paper presents an in-depth review and analysis of the advancements in synchronized waveform data, including measurement devices, data characteristics, use cases, and comparisons with synchrophasor data. Based on the ﬁndings, ﬁve strategies are proposed to discover and develop synchronized waveform based applications over multiple application areas. The paper also presents three complementary measurement platforms and two data screening algorithms for application implementation. It further discusses committee activities and standard developments useful to explore the full potential of the data.}, number={1}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery}, author={Xu, Wilsun and Huang, Zhenyu and Xie, Xiaorong and Li, Chun}, year={2022}, month=feb, pages={3–17} }

abstract = {Due to the increasing size and operational complexity of modern power systems, transmission system operators often have difficulties forming a complete and accurate picture of the state of the part of the system for which they are responsible. These difficulties may prevent them from achieving the level of situation awareness (SA) that they need to make the right decisions and respond effectively to an incident. Inadequate SA has indeed been identified as one of the contributing factors in several recent large electrical disturbances worldwide. This paper first reviews the fundamentals of SA and then discusses the main sources of operator errors due to insufficient SA in power systems and how these affect the operational decision-making process. It then discusses tools and standards that can help system operators improve their level of SA. Finally, a generic procedure for achieving sufficient SA is presented, which aims to guide the design of an information system that is both technology- and user-oriented.}
